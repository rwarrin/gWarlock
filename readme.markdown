gWarlock
==============

About
----------------------------
gWarlock is intended to be an extremely lite version of AddOns like DrainSoulTimer.  Because it is "lite" it does not have an in-game config, all configuration must be done inside of the core.lua file.

Features
---------------------------
gWarlock does two things for you.  First it will alert you when your current targets health drops below twenty-five percent.  Second it will alert you when your Drain Soul ability ticks and for how much, hopefully to help you know when it is okay to cancel the channel and refresh any DoTs that are about to expire.  Alerts are handled in three ways, using a sound, printing a message in the default chat frame and printing the same message in the raid warning popup area.
